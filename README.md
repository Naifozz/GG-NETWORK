# GG NETWORK

Creation of a REST API for a Fictional Social Network

The network is centered around the world of video games and offers various features: the creation of community groups, whether by YouTubers or players, the management of contests and a marketplace, as well as the announcement of live streams and new videos. It also includes a badge system, profile customization, and friend suggestions based on connected platforms.
